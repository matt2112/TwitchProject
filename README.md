# Twitch Interface
TwitchTV app developed using Angular 2 as part of FreeCodeCamp curriculum.

This is the fourth intermediate project in the freeCodeCamp curriculum. The rules can be viewed here:

Rather than simply use jQuery as I have done for the previous projects, I decided this would be a good opportunity to learn how to use Angular 2.
Aside from the official Angular 2 docs, Mosh Hamedani's Udemy course 'Angular 2 with TypeScript for Beginners' has been a lot of help.
