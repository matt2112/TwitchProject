# TwitchProject
TwitchTV app developed using Angular2 as part of FreeCodeCamp curriculum

This is the fourth intermediate project in the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. The rules can be viewed here:

Rather than use JQuery as I have done for the previous projects, I decided this would be a good opportunity to learn how to use Angular2.
Aside from the official Angular2 docs, Mosh Hamedani's Udemy course 'Angular 2 with TypeScript for Beginners' has been a lot of help.
